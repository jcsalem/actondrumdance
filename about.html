      <h4>Acton Drum and Dance Fire Circle</h4>
      <p>
      Celebrate a spring evening with drumming and dancing around a fire by the pond under the full moon! Now in our eleventh year, Acton Drum and Dance is about listening to each other, co-creating music and dancing our spirit. We welcome drummers, dancers, rhythmatists and flow artists of all kinds.
      </p>
      <p>      
      We dance and play to a mix of traditional African rhythms and organized rhythm jams. You're welcome to bring your own hand drums and percussion, or simply come to dance and enjoy. While many of us have studied drumming for years, others are new to the drum. We all can learn from each other as we create magical, danceable rhythms.</p>
      <p>The event is free and open to all ages and experience levels. Bring music from your heart and a sharing spirit. Please bring water to drink and snacks if you like. No alcohol! Bug repellent may be helpful at dusk.
      If you like to play while sitting, consider bringing a lightweight chair.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is a rain or shine event. A large shelter is available in case of inclement weather.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you come early, NARA has a pond, playground, BBQ grills and plenty of open areas.
